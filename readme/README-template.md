## Intro
This is a solution to the [Fylo dark theme landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor]. Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 
this was a challenge made for the front-end course (Dev Quest) of the advanced css module. the challenge proposed was to make a clone of a landing-page from the frontend mentor site.

### The challenge

the proposed challenge is from the junior level frontend mentor site according to himself.
in this challenge the user should be able to visualize the layout regardless of size
your device's screen and make it as similar as possible.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I used the knowledge acquired in the basic, intermediate and advanced html and css phases. I used the main concepts of html and css. flexbox, grid, responsive layout, variables are present among other things.


### html code snippet
```html 
<header class="cabecalho">
    <div class="cabecalho-container">
     
        <a class="logo" href="/">
          <img src="images/logo.svg" alt="logo">
        </a>
     
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#">Features</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">Team</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">Sign In</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
     
    </div>
  </header>
```
### css code snippet
```css
.cabecalho-container{
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    padding: 6rem 6rem;
    align-items: center;
    font-size: 1.4rem;
       
}
.cabecalho-container ul {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
```

### Continued development

 For new projects I will focus on flexbox , grid and javascript.
 now I'm going to start with basic js and I intend to improve my work with that.

## Conclusion

<h3>The proposed layout was very similar to that of the frontend mentor site, only some details were not placed such as shadows and social network icons.
Hears difficulty while working from middle to bottom of layout with flexbox and grid. the cards were the most work.
Also hears difficulties with responsive mode.
I believe that the code has gotten bigger than it should be, it's something that should be improved together with flexbox and grid.
In general the objective has been accomplished. In tests done using devtools and the Responsive viewer app, the responsive mode is working on several screen formats.</h3>
